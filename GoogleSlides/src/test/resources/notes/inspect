Yes, you can visually inspect the presentation and find the object ID of a specific element, such as a text box, using the Google Slides UI. Here's how you can do it:

Open the Google Slides presentation in your web browser.
Click on the element (e.g., text box) that you want to find the object ID for. This will select the element.
Right-click on the selected element and choose "Inspect" from the context menu. This will open the Developer Tools panel in your browser.
In the Developer Tools panel, look for the HTML element that represents the selected element. It will typically have a class name related 
to the element type (e.g., "text-box").
Expand the HTML element by clicking on the small triangle icon next to it.
Look for an attribute named "data-object-id" within the expanded HTML element. The value of this attribute is the object ID of the selected element.
For example, if you inspect a text box element, you might see something like this in the Developer Tools panel:
